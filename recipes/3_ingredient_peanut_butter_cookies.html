        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (256g) creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) sugar</li>
            <li>1 whole egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). </li>
            <li>To a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together the peanut butter and sugar until creamy, about 2-3 minutes.  Add the egg and continue to mix for another minute until fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Using a tablespoon or regular spoon, scoop cookie dough and form into balls and place them evenly on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet, about 8 cookies per cookie sheet. Press each round down with a fork twice in the shape of a plus sign to form a nice pattern.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. Allow them to cool before serving.</li>
        </ol>
