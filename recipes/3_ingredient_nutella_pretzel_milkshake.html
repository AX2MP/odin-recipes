        <h2>The easiest & best milkshake recipe upgrade ever.</h2>

        <p>I do believe that Nutella and pretzels may be one of the best combos ever. Just saying.</p>
        <p>This indulgent Nutella pretzel shake is made with 3 ingredients and takes just 4 minutes to make. This is a perfect refreshing and easy treat!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (360g) vanilla ice cream</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup (70g) Nutella, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>2 pretzel rods, 1 in the milkshake, 1 for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, combine the ice cream, one pretzel rod, and your Nutella and blend. Start on low until it begins to come together and then increase the speed to high until combined. </li>
            <li>Pour the milkshake into a glass and dip your other pretzel rod into your  container of Nutella and place it, Nutella side down, in your milkshake for a nice surprise. Serve and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
